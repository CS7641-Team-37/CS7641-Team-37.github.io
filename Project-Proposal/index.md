## 2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
Stock prediction algorithms are a staple in the machine learning world. Recently, however, polymarkets where users can place bets on things ranging from elections to sports outcomes have exploded, reaching ~$10b in monthly trade volume within less than two years of launch (see Figure 1). Our high level goal is to build a system which can optimally make investment decisions across both the stock and poly markets.

### 2.1 Problem

Because of the relative infancy of polymarkets, there is a lot of volatility in prices, risk, and options. This is contrary to more mature equity markets. There also may be much more diverse features which play a role in these younger markets, like social sentiment and narrative polarization. Similar trends may exist in the stock market, but it is hard to gauge transferability.

### 2.2 Motivation

This motivates a project which 1. identifies if the dimensionality of stock/poly markets is meaningfully different and 2. frames both domains as comparable forecasting tasks. This could be useful to identify which signals are transferable across markets and which are market-specific. This can guide future systems and help quantify when to prioritize cross-market and specialized learning.
